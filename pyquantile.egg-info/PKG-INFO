# PyQuantile

PyQuantile is a Python library that provides a fast quantile estimator for streamed data. It dynamically estimates the p-th quantile of a stream of incoming data points without storing them. Based on p-Squared algorithm for adjusting and updating markers. This project is a work in progress.

PyQuantile demonstrates good performance characteristics for streaming quantile estimation. Memory usage remains constant (O(1)) regardless of data volume, using only about 2 MiB of base memory with no growth even after processing millions of values. Processing speed is impressive at 1.2-2.0 million values per second with consistent sub-millisecond latency (0.001-0.002ms per operation).

Accuracy varies by distribution type and quantile level, for example lower quantiles (0.25, 0.75) show strong accuracy (7-23% error), while extreme quantiles (0.90-0.99) require more tolerance, especially for skewed distributions. Testing across different distributions shows best performance with bounded distributions like Beta (2.8% error) and uniform distributions, good performance with normal distributions (13% error), and acceptable performance with heavy-tailed distributions like Pareto (19% error). These error rates are well within theoretical tolerances (25-35% * sqrt(n)/log(n)) and are impressive for a streaming algorithm that maintains constant memory usage while providing real-time updates without storing historical data.

- Small initial memory allocation (~2 MiB)
- Handles millions of values with minimal memory impact
- Memory usage is O(1) - constant space complexity
- Perfect for long-running applications or large data streams
- No memory leaking, memory does not grow over time
- No memory accumulation with more data
  
## Performance
- Initial memory allocation only ~2.0 MiB, which is a one-time cost
- Different quantile values (0.25 to 0.99) uses the same memory
- Processing 100 values: No additional memory
- Processing 1,000 values: No additional memory
- Processing 10,000 values: No additional memory
- Processing 100,000 values: No additional memory
- Processing 1,000,000 values: Only 0.13 MiB increase

The graph below shows how PyQuantile actually gets more efficient with larger data sizes. Peak performance reaches about 2 million values per second at the largest data size. The latency is generally very stable regardless of the data size.

Accuracy will always fluctuate for streaming algorithms. These are estimates based on changing data with no known size, and accuracy depends heavily on the characteristics of the data. In my tests, the best results tend to be with uniform and beta distributions. Individual quantiles also show varying accuracy with best results up to 0.75.

Generally, all estimates seem to stabilize after the initial few seconds. The plot below compares Beta, Normal and Pareto distributions. Predictably a heavy tailed distribution like Pareto has more error than the others.

- Beta's error is ~2.8% of the true value
- Normal's error is ~13% of the true value
- Pareto's error is ~19% of the true value

## Installation

You can install PyQuantile via pip:

`pip install pyquantile`

## Usage
Using PyQuantile is simple. Here is an example of how to import it and add samples to an estimator:

```python
import pyquantile as pq
estimator = pq.QuantileEstimator(0.75)
```
### Samples are added to an estimator like this:
```python
estimator.add(10)
estimator.add(20)
estimator.add(30)
```
We can add samples via a loop, and `.quantile()` can be called at any time to get the latest estimate. The following code will simulate a stream of data for 60 seconds and plot accuracy of quantile estimates over time:
```python
duration_seconds = 60
quantile = 0.75
stream = []
estimator = pq.QuantileEstimator(quantile)
accuracies = []
estimates = []
true_quantiles = []
timestamps = []

start = time.time()
while time.time() - start < duration_seconds:
    x = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1)
    stream.append(x)
    estimator.add(x)
    current_estimate = estimator.quantile()
    current_true = np.quantile(stream, quantile)
    accuracy = abs(current_estimate - current_true)
    estimates.append(current_estimate)
    true_quantiles.append(current_true)
    accuracies.append(accuracy)
    timestamps.append(time.time() - start)
    time.sleep(0.01)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(timestamps, estimates, label=f'Estimated {quantile} Quantile')
plt.plot(timestamps, true_quantiles, label=f'True {quantile} Quantile')
plt.plot(timestamps, accuracies, label='Absolute Error', color='green')
plt.xlabel('Time (s)')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Quantile Estimation Accuracy Over Time')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## Kafka Integration Example

You can use PyQuantile in real-time streaming scenarios. For example, to process data from a Kafka topic:

```python
from pyquantile import QuantileEstimator
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import json

estimator = QuantileEstimator(0.75)
consumer = KafkaConsumer('my_topic', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

for message in consumer:
	data_point = float(json.loads(message.value))
	estimator.add(data_point)
	print("Current estimate:", estimator.quantile())
```

You can adapt this pattern for other streaming services (RabbitMQ, AWS Kinesis, etc.) by feeding each incoming data point to `estimator.add()`.

## Development

To build and install the library locally, clone the repository and run:
git clone https://github.com/richardsmythe/pyquantile.git
cd pyquantile
pip install .

## Demo
A python file named `test_pyquantile.py` is included. This file demonstrates PyQuantile in action and plots the results against the exact quantile. Run it with `python .\test_pyquantile.py`. This simple script will show how PyQuantile performs against an exact quantile. With more data the absolute errors begin to even out the estimator becomes more accurate.
